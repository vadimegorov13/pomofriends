  "description": "I originally built PomoFriends in 2020 as my capstone project. Since then, my skills have grown a lot, and the old version no longer represented the kind of product I want to build.\n\nThis release marks the beginning of a full revival of the app. I'm no longer abandoning it between updates — I'll be actively improving it, expanding features, and refining the experience until I eventually get bored (hopefully not anytime soon).",
