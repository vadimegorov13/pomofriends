# PomoFriends ⏳📖👥

_A social Pomodoro platform for accountability, productivity, and collaboration._

## Overview

PomoFriends combines the proven Pomodoro Technique with social interaction, group accountability, and task management. While many timer apps exist, few offer real-time groups, messaging, shared sessions, or visibility into what others are working on. PomoFriends fills that gap with a collaborative productivity environment.

## Why This Project Exists

Traditional Pomodoro apps help users focus but offer no sense of community. Without accountability, motivation drops and productivity becomes inconsistent.

Most apps lack:

- Group functionality
- Real-time chat
- Shared timers
- Task visibility among users

PomoFriends solves this by enabling users to focus together, communicate during breaks, and track progress socially.

## The PomoFriends Solution

PomoFriends allows users to:

- Create or join groups
- Collaborate via synced or individual Pomodoro timers
- Share tasks and progress
- Chat during breaks
- Automatically switch to distraction-free mode during focus sessions
- Track personal stats, earn achievements, and climb weekly leaderboards

When a Pomodoro session begins, chat locks and users see each member’s task and remaining time, reinforcing accountability.
